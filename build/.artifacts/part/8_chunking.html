	:title Chunking!
-->
<p>Chunking is now working on my personal Starship instance.
Every block of 40 posts results in the creation of a new chunk.
The <b>index.html</b> page contains 40 posts + however much
overflow exists from new posts.</p>
<p>Currently propagating changes over to main branch; I might post
again after that.</p>
