<p>Took Atcoder Regular Contest 185 this morning. I had
done one ARC virtual in the past, but that one had relatively
more 'normal' questions than today's contest. I think it went
alright? I don't really have a sense of scale with ARC yet.</p>
[[ENDSUM]]
<ul>
    <li>A: The key observation was: for Bob to
        win, he must create a configuration such that any of Alice's
        moves result in divisibility by M. It can be shown that as
        long as Alice has two or more possible moves, such a config
        cannot be forced. Therefore, Bob must create a configuration
        such that both Bob and Alice are on their last turn, and
        Alice's last piece will create divisibility by M.<br><br>
        This reduces the problem to: determine if Bob has some piece
        <i>i</i> such that the sum of all of his other pieces, and
        all of Alice's pieces is divisible by M.</li><br>
    <li>B: Messed around with tons of configurations until I found
        one that worked. Ended with 4 WA...</li><br>
    <li>C: I tried to turn this into some sort of graph problem:<br><br>
        First, sort the array of numbers. Then, consider the set of
        all pairs 1 &lt;= i &lt; j &lt;= n, which form a graph: two
        pairs are connected by an edge if either their <i>i</i> or
        <i>j</i> differ by 1 (but not both). Also, define the "cost"
        of a pair to be the sum a[i] + a[j].<br><br>
        It can be shown that with a dijkstra-like algorithm, the pairs
        can be processed <i>in order of increasing cost</i>. This I
        tried to use to extract all pairs of indices whose costs were
        bounded by <i>x</i>. For each of these pairs, binary search
        can be used to find if their missing element exists.<br><br>
        However, this got WA. If anything, I would have expected TLE,
        because the bound on # of relevant pairs isn't linear, but idk.</li><br>
    <li>D: Decomposes into EV of fully traversing a star graph with
        arms of length <i>m</i>. This corresponds essentially to
        visiting all of the ends of the arms, but I didn't know how
        to compute.</li><br>
    <li>E: By some pretty trivial DP there is an n^2 solution.
        Couldn't find a speedup; apparently this is a 'standard'
        configuration in chn..</li>
</ul>
