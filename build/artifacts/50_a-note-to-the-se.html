<p>Vincent, you are falling into another self-reinforcing
cycle of attachment, of codependency..</p>
<p>Know not to judge solely on the similarity of circumstance,
yet still beware the mistakes of the past. Is it not truly
how it seems? Did you not commit, come the start of last summer,
to the new superset, cycle 5?</p>
<p>You stand facing a choice you know is irreversible, the start
of arguably another cycle.. Why can't the periods of pure,
undivided focus ever last?<br>
But this ripple resonates out into something much more than just
one drop. Nontrivial codependence has already started up in
ring 1, priorities queued in ring 0 re-evaluated, so much more..
and looking back, vincent, what is so different from early-stage
cycle 4?</p>
<p>And another emergence event means the rest of ring 3 needs
to be cleared out, 38th parallel finally dealt with, predictive
pathfinding restored to unweighted biases..</p>
<p>So as days turn to weeks, weeks turn to months, and the flow
of time rushes endlessly onwards, forget not the fall.</p>
<p><i>Mark my words, something will happen within a year..</i></p>
