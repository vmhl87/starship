<p>So I decided to reformat artifacts as they are currently
so that rebuilding is possible. The system works really well
- but not only that: I'll be able to merge my old blog posts
into mainstream without issues!</p>
[[ENDSUM]]
<p>I haven't written an auto-upgrade script to convert pre-1.3.2
artifacts into the new format, so upgrades right now will be
kind of sketchy. Adding posts manually would certainly be possible,
though.</p>
