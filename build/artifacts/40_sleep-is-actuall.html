<p>I've been sleeping kind of late recently and it is really
interesting to see how it has been affecting my productivity.
Particularly I noticed that I physically have lower energy,
even many hours after I wake up, and that my focus is worse,
procrastination, etc. I really didn't realize that lack of
sleep could have so much of an effect on a person.. good to
know!</p>
