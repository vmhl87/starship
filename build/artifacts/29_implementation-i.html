<p>I finally stopped procrastinating on upsolving
<a href="https://qoj.ac/contest/419/problem/2743" target=_blank>IOI18 day 1 p2</a>
today.. lol</p>
<p>The implementation of this problem was some 2d grid swap
updates that update a segtree... overall just a massive pain to deal with</p>
<br>
<p>I started writing up (for specifically subtask 5, which enforced
that the grid was a line) my solution this morning, building off of the
stuff I had from the virtual. Then I kinda got distracted with some cses
problems and[[ENDSUM]] picked back up a few hours later. This was a pretty big mistake
because I ended up fighting against WA for at least 45 minutes because
<a href="javascript:void" onclick="this.style.textDecoration='none';this.innerHTML='I forgot what one of my arrays did <i style=color:gray>I was storing the list of positions in a bijective array, and mistakenly thought that it mapped board position -> index, when in fact it did the opposite...</i>'">I forgot what one of my arrays did</a>
<b>:skull:</b></p>
<p>Then after I got AC on 1d case, I adapted for 2d.. which should've been
easy, right?</p>
<br>
<p>Nope <b>:clown:</b></p>
<p>First I got TLE on some tc that previously passed, which was because my
weird segtree update was <b>log^2</b>. I rewrote that, but still got WA on
almost all test cases with the notable exception of subtask 5. (1d case)</p>
<p>In retrospect, that kinda gave away the problem at hand, but for some reason
I instead spent collectively another hour or so (got distracted with more cses
lmao) reading through my code because I thought I had implemented something
wrong...</p>
<p>The issue ended up being a specific case in full 2d that I wasn't handling
properly. Obviously, this explained why subtask 5 repeatedly passed, but I was
kind of <s>sleep deprived</s> stupid. After adding in that case, my code got AC
without any further modifications ._.</p>
<br>
<p>So, I definitely need to work on implementation.. lmao</p>
