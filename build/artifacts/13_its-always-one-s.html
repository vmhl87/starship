<p>I've been having trouble falling asleep recently.</p>
<p>No, it isn't anything physical - I'm not sick, and my
sleep schedule isn't quite erratic enough to be the cause.
What keeps me up at night is the future.</p>
[[ENDSUM]]
<br>
<p>Nine months ago, I would fall asleep easily - complacent, satisfied
at the time with what I had, and without a real direction in which to go.
My days were marked by the hour and minute rather than milestones passed
and old limits broken.</p>
<p>At the time I didn't care. I was too stupidly obsessed with the
little things I had thought I had achieved to put much thought into
what I would do next. And that's why I slept easy: I had nothing to
reflect over, and few future paths to consider.</p>
<br>
<p>But now as I lie in bed awake, my brain iterates through possibilities,
almost as if it's building a decision tree of my future actions, then
finding the best path. (Is it a DFS or BFS? Feels like a multi-goal A*,
but not sure.)</p>
<p>Either way, I'm not complacent. That's not to say I'm not happy
with where I am now - that would be a problem if so - but rather
that there exists, at the very least, a direction in which I can act.</p>
<p>..and then within time I do, and whatever result I reach can be
backpropagated and used to accelerate. It's a self-reinforcing process.</p>
<br>
<p>I think that's the most important life lesson I've learned over the past
five months - to never stop moving.</p>
<p>Like a fundamental particle, our position and direction in the
universal state space of life are uncertain. And Heisenberg's principle
applies to us too: One who becomes too satisfied with their position in
life, stagnating, loses sight of their direction, of where and what they
want to strive for. But on the other side: if one has a good idea of
their direction and enough determination to act, no longer do they have
to care about where they are <i>now</i> - only where they will <i>end up.</i></p>
<br>
<p>Some might fear action because they fear the associated possibility
of failure. But no...</p>
<p>Like a neural network that never strays far from its seed, never
growing or adapting, the decision not to change is the decision to
forgo <i>precisely what makes us human: the ability to make mistakes,
    but crucially, to learn from them.</i></p>
<p>We must fall to learn how to stand, trip to learn to walk.</p>
<p>And, to take inspiration from Olivia Rodrigo's hit song
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Step_Forward,_3_Steps_Back" target="_blank">1 step forward, 3 steps back</a> - take one step forward, then ten more -</p>
<p>Never walk. Run. And don't stop.</p>

    AI: like a neural network that never strays far from its
      seed, and never grows, to never change is to forgo precisely
      what makes us human: the ability to make mistakes, and then
      crucially, to learn from them.
    quantum: If we are too satisfied with our position in life,
      we lose sight of velocity, of direction. But if we instead
      fix our velocity, lock in what we want to achieve - no
      longer do we have to care about what we have now.
