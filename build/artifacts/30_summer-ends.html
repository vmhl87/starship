<p>Junior year begins tomorrow!</p>
<h3>Classes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Discrete Math :D</li>
    <li>AP Physics C (one of the last APs my school offers.. lol)</li>
    <li>Machine Learning</li>
    <li>Biology</li>
    <li>Chinese 5</li>
    <li>The Art of Persuasion (AP Lit but with a diff name bc school weird)</li>
</ul>
<p>I somehow ended up with
<a href="javascript:void" onclick="this.style.textDecoration='none';this.innerHTML='50% course overlap with two of my close friends <i style=color:gray>Discrete + Physics + Chinese w/ EZ, Bio + Persuasion + Chinese w/ JL</i>'">50% course overlap with two of my close friends</a>
- will be interesting for sure. Also my school gives an
<a href="javascript:void" onclick="this.style.textDecoration='none';this.innerHTML='obscene amount of free time <i style=color:gray>somewhere around 100 minutes / day avg</i>'">obscene amount of free time</a>
so I probably can get away with upsolving atcoders or something like that because
imagine socializing.</p>
