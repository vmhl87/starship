<p>idk, recently just not much going on / too busy to post /
too lazy etc. School been alr, had psats a while back. Bunch
of tests/projects recently but nothing really memorable.</p>
<p>Currently in LA; parents at 20-year Caltech reunion. Can't
do ABC/ARC both due to lack of time and also time zone.</p>
<p>Really interesting event though! Lots of accomplished people,
interesting presentations, etc. Been doing a lot of
self-reflection recently as well.</p>
