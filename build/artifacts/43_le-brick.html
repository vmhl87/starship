<p>vced ARC 058 w/ jasonwei</p>
<p>C was theoretically easy, construct from smallest
digit, etc. but I messed up overflow case [twice] and
that whole mess took like 30m total</p>
<p>D was fun combo, pathfinding nonsense that partition
&amp; track crossings kind of deleted</p>
<p>E was some DP that I failed, also managed to forget
that complementary counting existed.. smh</p>
<p>didn't have anything substantial on F besides "knapsack"
so ya</p>
<p>mid contest, definitely need to work on dp</p>
