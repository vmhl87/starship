<p>Up until about now I've been using the binlift from
<a href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/74847" target=_blank>this cf blog</a>,
which is linear in space and build complexity, but has a
higher constant factor. This has really never been useful
to me, and it's a little more complicated to write, too..</p>
