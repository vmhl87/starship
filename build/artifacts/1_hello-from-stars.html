<p>The old blog has been nuked due to major breaking
changes between <b>v1.2</b> and <b>v1.3</b> backend.
Most pages are now[[ENDSUM]] located in different
locations, and I would rather not reparse all of the
links in my old posts, so I won't integrate those old
posts into the main content of this blog. Instead, it's
located  <a href="https://vmhl87.github.io/starship/mainpage-old.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, tag support is working! Future Starship updates
will use the <b>starship-dev</b> tag. :)</p>
