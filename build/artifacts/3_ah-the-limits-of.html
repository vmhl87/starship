<p>I'm quickly realizing how useful the ability to
edit/delete previous pages is..</p>
<p>Not even just editing previous posts, but making
layout changes comes with an inconvenience factor which
scales <b>O(n)</b> with[[ENDSUM]] respect to # of pages.</p>
<p>Seriously considering writing a <b>rebuild.py</b>
script to collect and reformat all dynamically generating
pages on a site. This would definitely make format/template
changes much easier to propagate, or name changes. It
still wouldn't really make editing or removing posts any
easier, as summary artifacts are only being stored right now.</p>
<p>This would make addition of tags after the fact possible,
though, which I could certainly see being useful.</p>
<p>Anyway, I should decide on what to do with artifact
processing before it gets too late :P</p>
