<p>Today, I was working on some 3d matrix projection stuff
for some simulation, and needed a simple <b>sin()</b> approximation.
Because I was writing this in
<a href="javascript:void" onclick="this.style.textDecoration='none';this.innerHTML='a non-compiletime CBAS segment,<p class=quote-nocenter style=color:var(--content-color)>CBAS by default runs in an interpreter, providing actually surprisingly decent performance, but is also able to be transpiled into C and then compiled into a binary. Compiletime code has access to everything that is part of standard C, but interpreted code can only access external C functions if they are explicitly baked into the interpreter. Currently, only very basic standard functions have been builtin, like malloc, free, fgets, etc.</p>'">a non-compileime CBAS segment,</a>
I didn't have access to <b>&lt;math.h&gt;</b>, and was too lazy
to add builtin trig functions. That's when I remembered:
calc has a pretty simple way to approximate complicated functions
with polynomials!</p>
<p>Even better, I didn't need an approximation that would work over
all input values of theta - only between <b>-pi/2</b> and <b>pi/2</b>,
so a taylor series to three terms did the trick:</p>
