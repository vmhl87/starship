<p>Wow, school is starting soon!</p>
<p>Last year at the start of the school year I made a promise to
stop procrastinating. It didn't hold. The year before that I did the
same. It also didn't hold. I am again making a promise to stop procrastinating,
so surely by induction, it won't hold[[ENDSUM]]...</p>
<br>
<p>On a serious note, though, the beginning of school starts really shows
how much has changed since a year ago. I spent last summer primarily messing
around with random hardware and playing Minecraft. The usaco practice I did
was so infrequent and inefficient compared to what I'm doing now, and most of
all, I sunk upwards of a hundred hours into chasing after some girl because
I thought it could define my future...</p>
<p>But I love where I am now! I wouldn't go back even if I could.</p>
<br>
<p>The last half year has been such an

experience for me. And so: To

and so many more kind, smart, and motivated people who I have had the luck of
meeting over the last six months, I give my heartfelt gratitude.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for pushing me forward and motivating me when I could not.
You're all so interesting and talented and remind me that there are still some
good people in this world. I'm certain you'll go far and reach your goals and
so much more! :D</p>

<p>And so, here's to the conclusion of an amazing summer, and the start of something
new.</p>
<p>The future calls.</p>
