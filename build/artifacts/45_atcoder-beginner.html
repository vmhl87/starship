<p>Woke up 10 min before contest, slow start but
wow.. good contest I think</p>
[[ENDSUM]]
<p>A, B trivial, B was literally a 1:1 of strcmp I wrote
a little while ago for C*</p>
<p>C definition bitmask dp</p>
<p>D bruteforce permutation, pretty easy, extra 2^n factor
b/c segments can be reversed...</p>
<p>E was fun. General idea: binary search over answer, write
something to validate whether some W is reachable. Validation
was the hard part, tried dumb linear search for some reason
and got TLE, then tried to binary/ternary search, but func
wasn't convex, so that didn't work either.</p>
<p>Then I realized - the func was sorta overall convex, but
had variance at small scale. Basically: for some two
machines X and Y, where X is overall more efficient than Y,
it is never optimal to have more than 100 machines of type Y.
This is because: if machine X can produce U products, and
machine Y can produce V products, then U machines of type Y
can be exchanged for V machines of type X, and since U, V are
bounded by 100, this holds.</p>
<p>So this ended up being basically just a constant factor
and ended up with a runtime of 2ms. lmao O(log 1e7 * 100 * 100) ftw</p>
<p>F also very fun. I decided to just try the obvious DP of
{for each shipment i, group it with 0..k-1 of the next few
shipments}. Because of the delay between adjacent shipments
this was slightly questionable, but I assumed that each index
i would be given a non large number of different input timings,
and yoloed it. 20 min later and a really cursed std::map memo
got AC.</p>
<p>G looked interesting, decompose into directed graph, then
find min path cover? I figured that probably collapsing all
cycles and then processing the resultant DAG would be easier,
probably something about assigning each node a depth and then
counting max nodes on same depth over all components. No time
to implement but apparently this was sort of correct.</p>
<p>Overall really good though? I think I got lucky, my guesses
ended up being not too far off, and the problem types were ones
that I am pretty familiar with. Can't complain :D</p>
<p>anyway, ucuping later today w/ jasonwei, will probably work
on upsolving in afternoon. math circle tomorrow around noon,
then arc in afternoon, maybe more upsolve after that. will have
to burn through hw early morning I guess..</p>
