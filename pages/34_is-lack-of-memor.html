<p>Hey guys. Not a lot has happened recently,
so I haven't been posting a lot. I might try out semi-regular
casual posts similar to what <b>jasonwei</b> does. Not sure.</p>
<p>School has been going fine so far. Workload is actually kinda
suspiciously low, but it's probably going to increase a lot once
lang and physics ramp up.. Clubs and stuff are starting around now,
but I kinda don't have the time or energy to be that involved in
many (and contest club is out of question due to not enough ppl)
nor do really any of them particularly interest me tbh.</p>
<p>Some classes are kinda free rn so I can get away with coding
during them sometimes. Been working a little on CSES, but mostly
adding stuff to CBAS and fixing compiler bugs..</p>
<p>Also somehow im only rn hearing of the rest of my grade's drama,
like, &gt;=3 months after the fact??
idek my direct circle of friends is really
distanced from the rest of the grade, especially I guess considering
the size of the school. Probably a good thing tbh.</p>
<p>Local math circle starts this weekend :D :D really excited!
Lots of cool people.</p>
<p>Maybe expect another update in a few days?</p>
