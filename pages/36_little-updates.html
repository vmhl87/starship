<p>Weekend was pretty great. Took the atcoder on Saturday,
was pretty nice. Had to sort out a bunch of stuff for most
of the rest of the day, cant say here, kinda confidential.
Today had ARML practice :D :D then did a pretty quick half
cycle and kinda bricked on ioi18p5 <b>:skull:</b> oops</p>
<p>Atcoder breakdown:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A - lots of ways to do this one. I just did smth
        where I treated the arrows as directed edges, and
        kept counts of indegree/outdegree. Middle number
        was guaranteed to have both indeg + outdeg 1.</li><br>
    <li>B - trivial by any sort of fast insert/check
        structure; I used <b>std::set</b></li><br>
    <li>C - bash all possible permutations of the graph,
        efficiently find cost for each. Again just used
        set. Took way too long debugging a 1 letter typo
        in my solution (<b>g1</b> instead of <b>g2</b>),
        and so this took around 20m to implement instead
        of 10.. so cooked</li><br>
    <li>D - really standard range query. Coord compress
        into single array, then do the queries somehow.
        I know I could've used binary search + psum, but
        <b>std::lower_bound</b> kinda always trips me up
        and so I decided to... build a simple recursive
        segtree over the array and range query it.
        Overkill? It wasn't actually that bad...</li><br>
    <li>E - basically just
        <a href=https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1734 target=_blank>
            CSES distinct value queries</a>
        but without queries. Used a really similar
        idea to my solution to that task, but avoided
        using a segment tree entirely by noticing that
        we only need to mantain the total sum of the
        active segment... code
        <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmhl87/oly/main/contests/atcoder-sep14-24/e.cpp
           target=_blank>
            here</a>, pretty clean I think?</li><br>
    <li>F - realized that transforming each position
        <b>p_i</b> to <b>p_i - i</b> would make it such
        that any "adjacent" ranges of people would have
        equal position. Then it would be some mess of
        lazy segment tree or something that supports
        range sum &amp; range set.. Really didn't feel
        like writing up in contest, will probably upsolve
        at some later date when I get bored.</li><br>
    <li>G - messed around with some sort of cycle extraction
        + minimal cyclic shift solution, seems like it would
        be even more complicated than that b/c of modulus and
        gcd and other stuff idk. Might revisit sometime in the
        relatively far future, but no idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowkey the tasks felt very standard, A-E in particular.
I think last contest was more fun.</p>
<p>ARML practice was great! Topic was inequalities, ironically
it seems that though we've covered such no less than five times
over the past few years, I still don't entirely know how to apply
anything more complicated than basic AM-GM in a contest setting.
Usually I end up just calc bashing or something.. not optimal lol</p>
<p>Worked on ioi18p5 for a decent portion of the afternoon, I
think I have the tree case figured out (and MAYBE the graph
case as well) but implementation is not one of my strong points..
still do not have a bug-free solution to tree case.</p>
<p>Got most of my schoolwork out of the way
(<a href=javascript:void onclick="this.style.textDecoration='none';
this.innerHTML='<i style=color:grey>a substantial amount of the hw I thought I had to do was some reading for chn, but it turns out that I DID IT LAST CLASS BC I THOUGHT IT WAS ASSIGNED LMAO which is cool i think? It was pretty easy. Hopefully am not trolling..</i>'">note</a>)
and will be able to do virtual contests over the next week,
planning on either mon+tue or mon+wed, leaning towards tue
tho because of stuff on thursday. Also, Vivian moves into
college next weekend, so will be out of town - will miss
next ARML, sorry andrew</p>
<p>anyway, I have my chill classes tomorrow. A couple club
meetings I think? idk. gn pittsburgh!</p>
