<p>Took the contest 2 days ago but was pretty busy yesterday
(with some discrete math project skull) so doing writeup rn
in school lmao</p>

<h3>0:00 - 0:02</h3>
<p>Read through problems. p4 trivial w/ a bunch of casework.
p5 maybe possible to bruteforce small cases, p6 kinda impossible</p>
<h3>0:02 - 0:51</h3>
<p>The general idea for p4 was essentially just to determine
the shift in initial gondolas, then notice that replacement
(adding gondola <b>i</b>) can occur in any slot whose final
gondola is at most number <b>i</b>.</p>
<p>I did by subtasks - set 1 at 25 min, set 2 at 35 min, AC at
51 min.</p>
<h3>0:51 - 1:14</h3>
<p>Thought a bit more on p5 and p6. Small case on p5 trivial
by build whole graph, individual protocol cases handled by
separate cases. (prot. 0 must form tree, dp trivial, prot. 1
always forms disconnected graph, prot. 2 always makes complete
connected component, also trivial.)</p>
<p>p6 subtask 1 was obviously solveable with literally any
algo, went for the low-hanging fruit <b>2^n</b>. Couldn't
think of subquadratic, did see quadratic but for some reason
didn't see that subtask 2 was possible with it. idk</p>
<h3>1:14 - 1:55</h3>
<p>Wrote up individual cases for p5, passed subtasks 2-4 by
<b>1:39</b>. Then got small case at <b>1:55</b> for 46 pts.</p>
<h3>1:55 - 2:15</h3>
<p>Wrote up small case <b>2^n</b> on p6, 7 pts.</p>
<h3>2:22</h3>
<p>Directly out of contest log: "i claim that i am screwed
on p3"</p>
<h3>2:32</h3>
<p>Also from contest log: "i tentatively claim that i am
also screwed on p2"</p>
<br>
<p>So, that ended IOI 2014. With <b>325</b> points total,
this got me over the silver line.. (<b>323</b> points)</p>
