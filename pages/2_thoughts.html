<p>In an ideal world, Starship would run in C.</p>
<p>However, compatibility is important. The current build system
uses a collection of primarily Python scripts to collate static
blog content.</p>
<p><b>Starship v1</b> is completely static. However, this won't scale
well long-term, so plans are to use backend indexing to organize
each entry into a nearly-completely-formatted file, which will
be pulled by frontend JavaScript and inserted into the post list.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about JavaScript, though.</p>
<p>It <i>would</i> make several tasks much easier:</p>
<ul>
	<li>clipping pages to appropriate visual length</li>
	<li>front-end auto-loading of older entries</li>
	<li>various buttons and tooltips</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm still not sure though. I still kind of want to believe in
the dream of a fully static, Web 1.0 style blog which remains
fully functional even with javascript disabled. But that might not
be very possible without proper backend support.</p>
<p><i>Though...</i></p>
<p>Maybe if I do some cool datastructures trick I can avoid using
any server-side processing at all. I think I'll group posts in
either 20s or 30s, and have individual html files with each section
of posts from each time period/section.</p>
<p>Meaning, if I mantain some sort of linked list of post summaries
or formatted sectors - I can really easily push one new page to the
top of the list and sometimes propagate chunks of posts down through
the list. Not entirely sure at the moment.</p>

<h4>Planned substructure</h4>
<ul>
	<li>index.html</li>
	<li>style.css</li>
	<li>
		assets/
		<ul>
			<li>pic.png</li>
			<li>demo.c</li>
			<li>...</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		pages/
		<ul>
			<li>1_hello-world.html</li>
			<li>2_starship.html</li>
			<li>3_thoughts.html</li>
			<li>...</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		old/
		<ul>
			<li>1_old.html</li>
			<li>2_old.html</li>
			<li>...</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		build/
		<ul>
			<li>
				published/
				<ul>
					<li>1_hello-world.html</li>
					<li>...</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				drafts/
				<ul>
					<li>an-unfinished-post.html</li>
					<li>private.html</li>
					<li>ideas.html</li>
					<li>...</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>publish.py</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>build/</b> directory would store drafts (which would be
flagged under <b>gitignore</b>) as well as "published" pages. These
wouldn't be entire compiled pages with the title, styling, font, etc.
but rather snippets of HTML corresponding to their summarized view
which would appear in the main page. Fully compiled pages would be
located instead in <b>pages/</b>, and statically linked to by
<b>index</b>.</p>
<p>Datastructure would be very useful to ensure that each publish run
causes on average (or possibly: at most?) <b>O(log n)</b> cascades.</p>
<p><small>(It is also possible that I am way overcomplicating this, and
	there is no reason to need such a structure.)</small></p>
<p>A categories feature could be very nice! I will probably implement
a similar cascade system for that, except one cascade-list per
category, each in its own directory:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		categories/
		<ul>
			<li>
				programming
				<ul>
					<li>index.html</li>
					<li>1_old.html</li>
					<li>2_old.html</li>
					<li>...</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				toki pona
				<ul>
					<li>index.html</li>
					<li>1_old.html</li>
					<li>...</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>...</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Mantaining a static index.html page for each category will
be imperative as category links (on the main page, from posts
in said category) must be static for efficiency.</p>
<p>If (when?) I end up implementing this feature, it will almost
definitely be in <b>Starship v2</b> or later. <b>v1</b> release
will primarily target the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>single main page, no chunking</li>
	<li>individual full-form post links</li>
	<li>build dir with drafts</li>
</ul>
<p>Chunking will be the next big feature to add I think. Then would
be support for images/assets, and categories later IF I can get
chunking to work reliably for the main stream.</p>
<p>That's enough for now. I should probably get to work.</p>
<p>See ya later :P</p>
