<p>I did the ABC today: <a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc369" target=_blank>https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc369</a></p>
<p>The fumbling started on problem A, where I misread the
input format and consequently got 2 WA (don't worry
why this caused 2 WA and not 1). Then I did a dumb thing
and decided to switch between C, Python, and C++ for the next
few problems, which obviously resulted in mis-submits...</p>
<p>Somehow managed to get ABCD within 20 minutes even with
this nonsense.<br>But I then hit a wall at E/F.</p>
<br>
<p>Ironically G actually seemed solvable. Here's the summarized
problem statement:</p>
<p class=quote-nocenter>
Given a tree of size N, Alice and Bob play the following game:<br><br>
Alice picks K vertices on the tree.<br>
Then, Bob constructs a walk that begins and ends at vertex 1,
passing through all vertices chosen by Alice.<br><br>
The "score" is defined as the length of Bob's walk. Alice wants
to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it. Determine
for every K = 1, 2, ... N the score when both players are playing
optimally.
</p>
<p>Firstly, we can trivially show that it is always optimal for Alice
to pick leaves of the tree.</p>
<p>We can then prove that the solution for <b>K = i+1 (1 &lt; i)</b> must always
be the solution for <b>K = i</b> with zero or one leaves added. So, the answers
can be constructed iteratively by always picking the leaf which maximally
increases the walk length.</p>
<p>Using the DFS traversal order, we can find that each leaf adds the
<i>sum of lengths of unused edges above itself</i> to the walk length,
scaled by 2.</p>
<p>Programmatically we can simulate this by mantaining such a sum of edges
for each leaf. Anytime we choose a leaf, we have to <i>remove all the edges
    from itself to the root,</i> and update the sum of edges for the other
leaves.</p>
<p>Bruteforce for this seems like <b>O(n^3)</b> or something. Can we do better?
The costly step here is recomputing sum of lengths for each leaf. If we
use some euler tour + range update stuff, each edge removal can be done
in <b>O(log n)</b>, and because each edge can only be removed once, this amortizes
to <b>O(n log n)</b> total. This passes!</p>
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, I spent <i>just a little too long</i> debugging and only
got AC two minutes after contest end... I also kinda wasted a lot of time
midcontest, getting most of these observations around 00:30 - 00:40 but
only actually starting implementation at 00:50 or so.</p>
<p>rly gotta not throw next contest fr</p>
