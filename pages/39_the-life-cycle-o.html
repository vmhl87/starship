<p>The average small friend-group discord server starts simple, starts
close-knit. And time passes, friends of friends join, eventually forming
a distinction between the 'old' and the 'new'. More time passes, and the
climate slowly changes; no longer quite so close-knit. Then inevitably,
one of the first original members leaves. And this is in most cases the
beginning of the end, a change that can only be delayed, not reversed.</p>
<p>As more members leave, the server drifts farther away from the
vision it was set out to be, and more and more of the core members
go inactive or leave entirely. Once this reaches critical mass,
the server either burns out or overturns its members, its focus,
its goal.</p>
<p>This is a pattern I've seen countless times in online communities.
Muc like any other social space, they are in a continual, inevitable
state of change, in cycles where they are born, mature, grow old, and
eventually die.</p>
<p>But though same sort of patterns happen across nearly all social
circles, every cycle's start is unique, its middle-age plays out
unlike any before, and ends in its own way, too. So perhaps such a
pattern isn't about the rigidity of social norm, but a meta-pattern
in human behavior itself, and the way we respond and adapt to changes
in ourselves, those around us, and in the way we all interconnect -
seeing that larger, more physically-based communities still experience
the same effects but over a longer timescale, <i>what does this imply
    about the world we live in today?</i></p>
