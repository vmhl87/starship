<p>Easier contest (by nature of its age) but still
pretty fun. Due to schedule I started around 3 pm
and therefore ended at 8, on both days, so didn't
have much time to writeup each day separately.</p>

<ul>
    <li>A: trivial</li><br>
    <li>B: invert array, trivial</li><br>
    <li>C: trivial</li><br>
    <li>D: pretty cool, restructure directed graph as an
        undirected graph w/ directed weight, DFS</li><br>
    <li>E: possibly some sort of ranging and binary search,
        couldn't work out implementation</li><br>
    <li>F: tried to run the knapsack dp as normal but store
        a best_cost[] alongside, and attempted to use some
        quasi-convexity and 2p to speed up choice but this
        did not work (AC x53, WA x5)</li><br>
    <li>G: impossible wtf jasonwei orz</li>
</ul>
<p>terrible perf lol. should I take the upcoming AGC? idk.</p>

<p>I finally stopped procrastinating on upsolving
<a href="https://qoj.ac/contest/419/problem/2743" target=_blank>IOI18 day 1 p2</a>
today.. lol</p>
<p>The implementation of this problem was some 2d grid swap
updates that update a segtree... overall just a massive pain to deal with</p>
<br>
<p>I started writing up (for specifically subtask 5, which enforced
that the grid was a line) my solution this morning, building off of the
stuff I had from the virtual. Then I kinda got distracted with some cses
problems and...

<p>Completed the second half of IOI18. Performance was kinda eh,
but wasn't expecting much <b>:clown:</b></p>

<p>Solved Combo. Essentially the construction I found was to guess
the next 2 bits in the sequence over the course of two queries:
there were <b>3^2 = 9</b> possible arrangements of next bits, and
each query had three possible return values, which worked out to a...
