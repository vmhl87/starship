<p>I've been sleeping kind of late recently and it is really
interesting to see how it has been affecting my productivity.
Particularly I noticed that I physically have lower energy,
even many hours after I wake up, and that my focus is worse,
procrastination, etc. I really didn't realize that lack of
sleep could have so much of an effect on a person.. good to
know!</p>

<p>The average small friend-group discord server starts simple, starts
close-knit. And time passes, friends of friends join, eventually forming
a distinction between the 'old' and the 'new'. More time passes, and the
climate slowly changes; no longer quite so close-knit. Then inevitably,
one of the first original members leaves. And this is in most cases the
beginning of the end, a change that can only be delayed, not reversed.</p>
<p>As more members leave, the server drifts farther away from the
vision it was set out to be, and more and more of the core members
go inactive or leave entirely. Once this reaches critical mass,
the server either burns out or overturns its members, its focus,
its goal.</p>
<p>This is a pattern I've seen countless times in online communities.
Much like any other social space, they are in a continual, inevitable
state of change, in cycles where they are born, mature, grow old, and
eventually die.</p>
<p>But though the same sort of patterns happen across nearly all social
circles, every cycle's start is unique, its middle-age plays out
unlike any before, and ends in its own way, too. So perhaps such a
pattern isn't about the rigidity of social norm, but a meta-pattern
in human behavior itself, and the way we respond and adapt to changes
in ourselves, those around us, in the way we all interconnect;
Seeing that larger, more physically-based communities still experience
these same effects but over a longer timescale, <i>what does this imply
    about the world we live in today?</i></p>

I didn't have access to <b>&lt;math.h&gt;</b>, and was too lazy

<p>Hey guys. Not a lot has happened recently,
so I haven't been posting a lot. I might try out semi-regular
casual posts similar to what <b>jasonwei</b> does. Not sure.</p>
<p>School has been going fine so far. Workload is actually kinda
suspiciously low, but it's probably going to increase a lot once
lang and physics ramp up.. Clubs and stuff are starting around now,
but I kinda don't have the time or energy to be that involved in

nor do really any of them particularly interest me tbh.</p>

<p>Hey yall. Been a <i>while</i> :P</p>
<p>My schedule has been kinda strange ever since coming back
from road trip - firstly I started a project with some friends
over that trip, SARA, which took up a decent portion of my first
few days back. Then I had to deal with some school related stuff,
and got involved with a new project after that... and all in all I
haven't had had as much time to work on contest recently, or update
this blog.</p>
<p>Finally decided to allocate a block of time to updating blog,
so here we are! (hence the title)</p>
<p>Also, now that most of the projects I've been working on are at
reasonably complete stages, I can talk a bit about them here! This is
a short overview of what I've been up to recently:</p>

<p>I've been having trouble falling asleep recently.</p>
<p>No, it isn't anything physical - I'm not sick, and my
sleep schedule isn't quite erratic enough to be the cause.

which used state machine DP, into a <b>O(log n)</b> one, by using
matrix exp.</p>
<p>But even though I've used it quite a few times before, it still
feels like magic. Take this task for example:</p>

<hr>
<p>Previously, we created a basic particle-based physics engine.
Each point was stored as simply a position and velocity, and
iterated to produce natural-looking motion.</p>
<p>How can we extend this to more complex shapes?</p>
<p>Before we even try to simulate such shapes, we'll need a
way to store them. A simple point can be represented fully with
a position and velocity, as...
