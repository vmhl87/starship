<p>idk, recently just not much going on / too busy to post /
too lazy etc. School been alr, had psats a while back. Bunch
of tests/projects recently but nothing really memorable.</p>
<p>Currently in LA; parents at 20-year Caltech reunion. Can't
do ABC/ARC both due to lack of time and also time zone.</p>
<p>Really interesting event though! Lots of accomplished people,
interesting presentations, etc. Been doing a lot of
self-reflection recently as well.</p>

<p>Took Atcoder Regular Contest 185 this morning. I had
done one ARC virtual in the past, but that one had relatively
more 'normal' questions than today's contest. I think it went
alright? I don't really have a sense of scale with ARC yet.</p>

<p><a href="https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2080" target=_blank>Problem statement</a></p>
<p>Actually very similar problem to IOI11p2 (Race) which I did last weekend,
using centroid decomposition and then naive dp. Decided to write this one in
C*, which was surprisingly easy.</p>

<p>vced ARC 058 w/ jasonwei</p>
<p>C was theoretically easy, construct from smallest
digit, etc. but I messed up overflow case [twice] and
that whole mess took like 30m total</p>
<p>D was fun combo, pathfinding nonsense that partition
&amp; track crossings kind of deleted</p>
<p>E was some DP that I failed, also managed to forget
that complementary counting existed.. smh</p>
<p>didn't have anything substantial on F besides "knapsack"
so ya</p>
<p>mid contest, definitely need to work on dp</p>

<p>Easier contest (by nature of its age) but still
pretty fun. Due to schedule I started around 3 pm
and therefore ended at 8, on both days, so didn't
have much time to writeup each day separately.</p>
