<p>Wow, school is starting soon!</p>
<p>Last year at the start of the school year I made a promise to
stop procrastinating. It didn't hold. The year before that I did the
same. It also didn't hold. I am again making a promise to stop procrastinating,
so surely by induction, it won't hold...

<p>Hey yall. Been a <i>while</i> :P</p>
<p>My schedule has been kinda strange ever since coming back
from road trip - firstly I started a project with some friends
over that trip, SARA, which took up a decent portion of my first
few days back. Then I had to deal with some school related stuff,
and got involved with a new project after that... and all in all I
haven't had had as much time to work on contest recently, or update
this blog.</p>
<p>Finally decided to allocate a block of time to updating blog,
so here we are! (hence the title)</p>
<p>Also, now that most of the projects I've been working on are at
reasonably complete stages, I can talk a bit about them here! This is
a short overview of what I've been up to recently:</p>

<p>Over the course of the past week, I've had a lot of ideas come through
my head that I haven't been able to incorporate into blog posts of their own.
I'll try to put them out here, and hopefully some meaning can be derived
from my ramblings...

<p>I've been having trouble falling asleep recently.</p>
<p>No, it isn't anything physical - I'm not sick, and my
sleep schedule isn't quite erratic enough to be the cause.
What keeps me up at night is the future.</p>

<p>I've been doing a lot of thinking recently about the flow of time.</p>
<p>The summer days are kind of blending together into a blur - a blur so
reminiscent of last summer, when the days ran long and time seemed to stand
still...
