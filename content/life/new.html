<p>The average small friend-group discord server starts simple, starts
close-knit. And time passes, friends of friends join, eventually forming
a distinction between the 'old' and the 'new'. More time passes, and the
climate slowly changes; no longer quite so close-knit. Then inevitably,
one of the first original members leaves. And this is in most cases the
beginning of the end, a change that can only be delayed, not reversed.</p>
<p>As more members leave, the server drifts farther away from the
vision it was set out to be, and more and more of the core members
go inactive or leave entirely. Once this reaches critical mass,
the server either burns out or overturns its members, its focus,
its goal.</p>
<p>This is a pattern I've seen countless times in online communities.
Muc like any other social space, they are in a continual, inevitable
state of change, in cycles where they are born, mature, grow old, and
eventually die.</p>
<p>But though same sort of patterns happen across nearly all social
circles, every cycle's start is unique, its middle-age plays out
unlike any before, and ends in its own way, too. So perhaps such a
pattern isn't about the rigidity of social norm, but a meta-pattern
in human behavior itself, and the way we respond and adapt to changes
in ourselves, those around us, and in the way we all interconnect -
seeing that larger, more physically-based communities still experience
the same effects but over a longer timescale, <i>what does this imply
    about the world we live in today?</i></p>

<p>Wow, school is starting soon!</p>
<p>Last year at the start of the school year I made a promise to
stop procrastinating. It didn't hold. The year before that I did the
same. It also didn't hold. I am again making a promise to stop procrastinating,
so surely by induction, it won't hold...

<p>Hey yall. Been a <i>while</i> :P</p>
<p>My schedule has been kinda strange ever since coming back
from road trip - firstly I started a project with some friends
over that trip, SARA, which took up a decent portion of my first
few days back. Then I had to deal with some school related stuff,
and got involved with a new project after that... and all in all I
haven't had had as much time to work on contest recently, or update
this blog.</p>
<p>Finally decided to allocate a block of time to updating blog,
so here we are! (hence the title)</p>
<p>Also, now that most of the projects I've been working on are at
reasonably complete stages, I can talk a bit about them here! This is
a short overview of what I've been up to recently:</p>

<p>Over the course of the past week, I've had a lot of ideas come through
my head that I haven't been able to incorporate into blog posts of their own.
I'll try to put them out here, and hopefully some meaning can be derived
from my ramblings...

<p>I've been having trouble falling asleep recently.</p>
<p>No, it isn't anything physical - I'm not sick, and my
sleep schedule isn't quite erratic enough to be the cause.
What keeps me up at night is the future.</p>

<p>I've been doing a lot of thinking recently about the flow of time.</p>
<p>The summer days are kind of blending together into a blur - a blur so
reminiscent of last summer, when the days ran long and time seemed to stand
still...
