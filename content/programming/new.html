<hr>
<p>Previously, we created a basic particle-based physics engine.
Each point was stored as simply a position and velocity, and
iterated to produce natural-looking motion.</p>
<p>How can we extend this to more complex shapes?</p>
<p>Before we even try to simulate such shapes, we'll need a
way to store them. A simple point can be represented fully with
a position and velocity, as...

<p>In this blog post, we'll be covering the basics of how
iteration-based physics works,and then implementing a
very simple proto-engine in C.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's start with some background on iterative simulations
as a whole.</p>
<p>Essentially all computer animations are done iteratively.
Computer displays have a finite...
