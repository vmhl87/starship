<p>Actually very similar problem to IOI11p2 (Race) which I did last weekend,
using centroid decomposition and then naive dp. Decided to write this one in
C*, which was surprisingly easy.</p>

<p>vced ARC 058 w/ jasonwei</p>
<p>C was theoretically easy, construct from smallest
digit, etc. but I messed up overflow case [twice] and
that whole mess took like 30m total</p>
<p>D was fun combo, pathfinding nonsense that partition
&amp; track crossings kind of deleted</p>
<p>E was some DP that I failed, also managed to forget
that complementary counting existed.. smh</p>
<p>didn't have anything substantial on F besides "knapsack"
so ya</p>
<p>mid contest, definitely need to work on dp</p>

<p>Today, I was working on some 3d matrix projection stuff

I didn't have access to <b>&lt;math.h&gt;</b>, and was too lazy
to add builtin trig functions. That's when I remembered:
calc has a pretty simple way to approximate complicated functions
with polynomials!</p>
<p>Even better, I didn't need an approximation that would work over
all input values of theta - only between <b>-pi/2</b> and <b>pi/2</b>,
so a taylor series to three terms did the trick:</p>

<p>Hey yall. Been a <i>while</i> :P</p>
<p>My schedule has been kinda strange ever since coming back
from road trip - firstly I started a project with some friends
over that trip, SARA, which took up a decent portion of my first
few days back. Then I had to deal with some school related stuff,
and got involved with a new project after that... and all in all I
haven't had had as much time to work on contest recently, or update
this blog.</p>
<p>Finally decided to allocate a block of time to updating blog,
so here we are! (hence the title)</p>
<p>Also, now that most of the projects I've been working on are at
reasonably complete stages, I can talk a bit about them here! This is
a short overview of what I've been up to recently:</p>

<p>How can we extend this to more complex shapes?</p>
<p>Before we even try to simulate such shapes, we'll need a
way to store them. A simple point can be represented fully with
a position and velocity, as...

<p>In this blog post, we'll be covering the basics of how
iteration-based physics works,and then implementing a
very simple proto-engine in C.</p>

<p>Let's start with some background on iterative simulations
as a whole.</p>
<p>Essentially all computer animations are done iteratively.
Computer displays have a finite...
