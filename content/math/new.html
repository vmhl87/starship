<p>Today, I was working on some 3d matrix projection stuff
for some simulation, and needed a simple <b>sin()</b> approximation.
Because I was writing this in
<a href="javascript:void" onclick="this.style.textDecoration='none';this.innerHTML='a non-compiletime CBAS segment,<p class=quote-nocenter style=color:var(--content-color)>CBAS by default runs in an interpreter, providing actually surprisingly decent performance, but is also able to be transpiled into C and then compiled into a binary. Compiletime code has access to everything that is part of standard C, but interpreted code can only access external C functions if they are explicitly baked into the interpreter. Currently, only very basic standard functions have been builtin, like malloc, free, fgets, etc.</p>'">a non-compileime CBAS segment,</a>
I didn't have access to <b>&lt;math.h&gt;</b>, and was too lazy
to add builtin trig functions. That's when I remembered:
calc has a pretty simple way to approximate complicated functions
with polynomials!</p>
<p>Even better, I didn't need an approximation that would work over
all input values of theta - only between <b>-pi/2</b> and <b>pi/2</b>,
so a taylor series to three terms did the trick:</p>

<p>I swear binary exponentiation on matrices is actually magic.</p>
<p>While explaining <a href="https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2413/"
                       target=_blank>this CSES problem</a> to a
friend, it occured to me that I could improve my <b>O(n)</b> solution,
which used state machine DP, into a <b>O(log n)</b> one, by using
matrix exp.</p>
<p>But even though I've used it quite a few times before, it still
feels like magic. Take this task for example:</p>

<p>I was shown this puzzle by <b>@hy3na_xyz</b>, a member of the Rutgers
competitive programming discord server. Credit goes to them!<p>
<b style="display:inline-block; margin:1em; font-weight: normal;">Given an
N-dimensional tic-tac-toe board of side length L, how many winning
paths are there? A winning path is a sequence of L cells that
follow a linear path through the N-dimensional hypercube of the
game board.</b>
